This personal project was focused on building a movie listing CRUD application with React and Express. I created a backend using Mongoose and Express, while on the frontend I concentrated on deepening my understanding of React. I experimented with advanced concepts such as custom hooks, global state management, and reducers to gain full control over React’s internal logic.

The main challenges were mastering reducers and learning when to refactor code into custom hooks in order to maintain a clean and scalable architecture.

The most rewarding achievement was being the only one in my class to fully embrace React’s advanced capabilities, demonstrating initiative and a strong drive to push beyond the standard use cases.
