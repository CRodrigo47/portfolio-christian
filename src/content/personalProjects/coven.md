I developed a mobile application using Expo and React Native with TypeScript, supported by Supabase as the backend (BaaS) and a PostgreSQL relational database. The architecture was designed to enable direct communication between the frontend and Supabase services in the cloud, handling authentication, secure storage, and database access policies.

A key achievement was the successful integration of multiple libraries to enhance functionality and user experience, including React Hook Form with Yup for form validation, React Native Reanimated for smooth animations, Nativewind for utility-first styling, and Zustand for global state management. I also configured and optimized Postgres row-level security policies in Supabase, which required a deep understanding of permissions and database logic.

Throughout the project, I overcame significant challenges such as configuring Google login and image uploads (limited by Expo Go and native build requirements), managing frequent data fetching that conflicted with React state updates, and addressing issues with Nativewind setup. Despite these obstacles, I stabilized the application, optimized state handling, and laid the groundwork for adopting Supabase Realtime to improve data synchronization.

This project strengthened my problem-solving skills and adaptability, proving my ability to learn and implement new technologies quickly. Looking ahead, my next steps include refactoring the codebase with a cleaner architecture, creating native Android builds to enable pending features (Google login, image uploads), and expanding the online functionality with features such as event search and real-time chat between users.
