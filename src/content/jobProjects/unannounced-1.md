I led the development of the projectâ€™s first phase using Expo, starting from the initial architecture design and applying Atomic Design principles and SOLID guidelines. I implemented the routing system with React Router, built the registration flow, and developed several key pages including profile and reviews. I was also responsible for testing this first phase to ensure routing stability and maintainability.

A major challenge was adapting to working with SOLID principles in a clean and structured way, as well as transitioning from Expo Router (used in my thesis project) to React Router. I also had to learn the fundamentals of testing with Jest, which shaped the way I approached quality assurance in the project.

The greatest achievement was successfully delivering the entire project skeleton with strong architectural foundations and receiving excellent feedback from the team for the clarity and robustness of the implementation.
