In this project, I was given freedom to use it as a playground to improve my skills in reading and extending an already completed codebase. I worked on debugging and implementing new features, such as fixing search functionality with special characters and creating a modal for selecting Verdatis delivery dates. Once familiar with the codebase, I took on a more collaborative role, working on integrating Drupal data flows and holding meetings with the backend team to align with their requirements.

The main challenges included understanding where to start within a large existing codebase, moving confidently without breaking functionality, and adapting to a new workflow.

My biggest success was being able to deliver exactly what the backend team needed, integrating seamlessly with their requirements without forcing changes, which earned me trust and credibility within the team.
